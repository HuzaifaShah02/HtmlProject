    <p><i>The great leader and founder of Pakistan. His real name is Mohammad Ali Jinnah but widely known as Quaid-e-Azam or Baba-e-Qoum which means the father of the nation. Quaid-e-Azam was born on the 25th of December in Karachi, in 1876. Quaid-e-Azam was a successful lawyer as well as a politician. Quaid-e-Azam’s father’s name was Jinnah Poonja and his mother’s name was Mithibai. Quaid-e-Azam belonged to a rich merchant family. Quaid-e-Azam received his early education from Sindh Madrasa-ul-Islam and a Christian missionary school. He was sent to England at the mere age of 16 for higher education and later got admission to Lincoln’s Inn Law school to study Law. He returned home after studying abroad, then took over managing his family business.</i></p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p><i>A few years later, Quaid-e-Azam opened his law firm and became a successful lawyer and by 1900, he was appointed as a magistrate for the region’s presidency. During this time, Jinnah noticed that Hindus and Muslims were united against England, but the Hindu leaders had set their interests somewhere else. Soon after this Quaid-e-Azam left behind practicing law and went on to join political parties so he could take up leadership positions among organizations that planned to form Pakistan’s identity. He started his political career with Indian National Congress in 1906, then after a time span of 7 years, Jinnah joined the Muslim League.</i></p>
    <h2>Aim</h2>
    <p><i>Quaid-e-Azam was a man with great qualities and leadership. He was a human rights activist who constantly fought for the rights of Muslims and dedicated his whole life to the liberation of Pakistan. He tirelessly worked for the Muslims struggling in India and presented their concerns in the 14 points which were rejected by Congress. He endured many hardships for the formation of Pakistan and the rights of Muslims, but he did not give up. However, his efforts did not go unrewarded.</i></p>
    <h2>Winning</h2>
    <p><i>Quaid-e-Azam was a man of his word and one of the greatest spokesmen. Mahatma Gandhi called Quaid-e-Azam “an impossible man” due to his determinacy over his principles. Jinnah always stood like a rock in front of his enemies and never backed down. In 1933, Jinnah became the leader of the Muslim League. In 1940, the Pakistan resolution was drafted by The Muslim League at Minar-e-Pakistan. After the Pakistan Resolution was passed, Quaid-e-Azam worked tirelessly day and night and did not care about his health at all, slowly his health started deteriorating but he never stopped working. It was due to Quaid-e-Azam’s tireless efforts that Pakistan came into being on the 1947, 14th of August. Quaid-e-Azam passed away on the 11th of September in 1948.</i></p>
